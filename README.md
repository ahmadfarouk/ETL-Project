# ETL-Project

Order to excute the code originally was:
1- OMDB.ipynb -- Extract OMDB API data

2- TMDB.ipynb  -- Extract TMDB API data

3- TMDB-OMDB.ipynb  -- combines all data in one extracted csv

4- Project-2-Local.ipynb -- the last code file is used to Transform and Load the data


I have updated this now to be all form one file:

## Project-2-Local.ipynb


Intermediate csv files have been created to save the results from the API calls then used in the last file to load into the Postgres database.
